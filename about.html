        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Hi, I‚Äôm Allwell. I am excited to share my professional background and
          interests with you. My journey began in a small town called Owerri in
          Nigeria, where I was born. Then I pursued my education in the United
          Kingdom, studying Mechanical Engineering at Cambridge and Essex. My
          goal was to build a flying car, and while I have not yet achieved that
          dream, I‚Äôm still looking forward to doing something equally as
          innovative. For my research papers, I majored in the innovative
          technology of the Hyperloop and maglev trains.
        </p>
        <p>
          STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) topics have
          always fascinated me. Throughout my studies and career, I have been
          fascinated by the potential of technology to solve real-world
          problems. I have a natural inclination towards math and enjoy the
          thrill of tackling complex technical challenges. My technical skills
          include web development, design, digital marketing, and cybersecurity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my professional pursuits, I am also grounded in my
          faith and an active believer in Jesus Christ. On Sundays, you will
          find me in church. I have always loved creating and building things. I
          learned music at a young age. And through tech, got into music
          production using DAWs (which stand for Digital Audio Workstations) ‚Äì
          music production software like Ableton Live, FL Studio, and LogicX.
        </p>
        <p>
          After university, I delved into web development and WordPress, and now
          have a successful career building websites for businesses and
          eCommerce brands across a wide range of industries, including travel
          and tourism, consulting and procurement, entertainment, law and legal,
          electrical distribution, and healthcare. I pride myself on my ability
          to adapt and excel in any project I take on.

        <h2>Why I joined AltSchool</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          I joined AltSchool because I wanted to push myself to learn tech
          skills that matter in the global industry (such as Front-end,
          Back-end, and Cloud Engineering), enlarge my network, and learn to
          engage in developer communities.

        <h2>What I plan to achieve with AltSchool</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Pretty much what I stated in the previous question as my goal of
          joining AltSchool. That said, ultimately, I want to leave AltSchool
          many level higher and larger than I was when I joined. In terms of
          knowledge, computer skill, developer communications, and wealth. The
          money aspect is important and though it's not the major reason I
          joined AltSchool (as hardwork matters to accrue tech money over time),
          it's part of my motivation of plans to achieve afterward - second only
          to my desire to solve technical problems.
